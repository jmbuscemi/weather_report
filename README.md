# Weather Report

## Description

This application pulls data from multiple [Weather Underground API](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?MR=1) endpoints and presents a weather report to the user.

## Features
The user is prompted for a location (City, State or Zipcode) and the application `puts` to the screen the following:

* Current conditions at that location.
* 10 day forecast for that location.
* Sunrise and sunset times.
* Any current weather alerts.
* A list of all active hurricanes (anywhere).
